                The result of the first sprint is a functional prototype. If you're not satisfied with our cooperation, we can end the cooperation or reconfigure it.

                Contracts are flexible with a 1-3 month notice period. At the same time, our procedures guarantee that anyone else can pick up up on our work where we ended it.
