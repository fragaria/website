  challenge: Delivering an e-voting app for civic participation
  desc: >
    Delivering an e-voting application is nothing simple: security, scalability and reliability cannot accept any compromises. We were privileged to be hired as the sole tech supplier for D21 &ndash; a civic participation and decision-making online platform (from January 2015 until June 2018). Citizens of Říčany regularly use D21 to decide on how to <a class="anchor anchor--emphasized" href="http://www.ridimricany.cz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spend 5 million CZK</a> from the city budget, as well as the citizens in <a class="anchor anchor--emphasized" href="/blog/2016/05/11/jak-jsme-pocitali-new-york-aneb-aws/">NYC with their $30 million budget</a>. Our experts successfully kicked-off the project for a sustainable future development.

  challenge: Disrupting the travel industry with blockchain
  desc: >
    Winding Tree is aiming to disrupt the worldwide travel industry by using <a href="https://blog.windingtree.com/current-technical-state-of-hotel-platform-e5dd5ff49f20" class="anchor anchor--emphasized" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum blockchain and other emerging decentralized technologies</a>. As part of a worldwide distributed development team, we are researching and implementing an open-source platform &ndash; that aims to cut the middlemen and allow entry of more competition into the travel industry. We are also creating tools that significantly decrease the effort required to start working with the platform. Even if you are not familiar with blockchain, smart contracts and other terms used by the community gathered around cryptocurrencies and decentralized technologies &nbsp; we can break this down for you.

- title: Logman
  challenge: Scaling bank logs to make life easy
  desc: >
    Logman is the <i>central logging facility</i> in Komerční banka (Societe Generale Group). It’s not just a log storage though, it also makes browsing the logs a breeze as they can be looked up and visualized in <a class="anchor anchor--emphasized" href="https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kibana</a> (along with all the necessary details like comprehensive permissions setup). Given the large volume; scaling using <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" class="anchor anchor--emphasized" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes</a> is a no-brainer. Our team has come up with a solution complex enough to accommodate dozens of internal systems with varying requirements, yet without sacrificing long-term maintainability.

- title: Prezident 21
  challenge: Creating a new and innovative voting game with 3 million visitors
  desc: >
    As a part of our long-term partnership with Democracy 21 (D21) &ndash; see above, we participated in creation of the internet game &ndash; <a href="https://www.prezident21.cz/" class="anchor anchor--emphasized" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prezident 21</a> &ndash; which hit the public big-time during 2017-2018. This pre-election game was a supplement to the real presidency vote in 2018 and demonstrated how the vote would have ended if people could have used the D21 voting method. Contrary to the current voting method, D21 is not limited to a single vote only. Instead, it allows for multiple plus votes and optionally, also minus votes. Our complete solution included a robust infrastructure setup to handle peak times during various offline and online marketing activities. The site had hit <i>3&nbsp;million visitors</i> throughout its lifetime.
